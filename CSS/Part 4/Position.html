<!-- Position-Static : The top, bottom, left, right and z-index properties have no effect.
                        This is a default value.
-->

<!-- Position-Relative : The offset is relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom and left. -->

<!-- Position-Absolute : The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
                        It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise,
                        it is placed relative to the initial containing block. -->

<!-- Position-Fixed : The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
                    It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport. -->
