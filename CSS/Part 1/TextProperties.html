        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
        Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, 
        and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, 
        the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and 
        received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, 
        Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, 
        the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk.

    <h2>Publication History</h2><hr>
    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense. 
        Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and horror comics. 
        Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date. 
        Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of issues with printing.
        Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, 
        Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he could write the stories himself.

    <h3>Fictional Character Biography</h3>
    <p>
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. 
        As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries when his parents were killed in a car crash.
        Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. 
        His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, 
        who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man. 
        The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, 
        which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. 
        This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's publication history.
        This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,
        and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.
