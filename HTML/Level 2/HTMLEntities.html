<!--Notes : HTML Entities-->
<!--An HTML entity is a piece of text("string") that begins with an ampersand(&) and ends ith a semicolon(;).
    It is used to display reserved characters(which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters(line non-breaking spaces).
    It can also be used in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
    Your browser interprets them & renders correct character.
